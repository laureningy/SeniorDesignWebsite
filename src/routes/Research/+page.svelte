        <p> Based on the research conducted so far, there have been no previous attempts to combine bone stimulation and muscle stimulation treatments into a single device. From the perspective of a patient, the main competitors would be devices that provide only one type of treatment. The device would also have to compete with the alternative of seeing a professional who could perform the treatments with their own devices. From the perspective of a hospital or high-end facility, the device would be competing with much more sophisticated and expensive devices than would be available to a patient. This device is not intended for this market, but rather for a consumer similar to a smaller physical therapy practice. In this market, the device would again be competing with other devices that only offer one type of treatment. However, the device may not do as well in this market if the device is not being transported between a patient’s home and the doctor’s office. This device will be marketed towards home use, so that the patient has easier access to treatments, with the aim of improving recovery time.
            While there are no combined bone and muscle stimulation devices for patient use currently, the device will still need to be comparable to available in-office treatments. Additionally, there exists prescription bone and muscle stimulation devices that are designed to be used at home. One muscle stimulation device currently available is the Quattro 2.5 from Roscoe Medical, which is intended only for professional use, not for use by the patients themselves. It is small and portable, allowing doctors to bring it to their patients, or use it at their clinic, and it is designed for tabletop, therapy cart or mobile use (Richmar, n.d.). Another device on the market is the Katalyst, which is a wearable EMS vest that is intended to be used at home during exercise to help build strength and accelerate recovery from injuries (KATALYST, n.d.). It is expensive, priced at $2,499 with a membership fee of $29 - $49/month for the app, which requires an iPad to use. The app sends commands to the impulse pack, which translates the commands into impulses that are delivered through electrodes in the suit to the right muscle at the right time. The suit is battery powered and lightweight, making it easily portable.
            Orthofix produces several bone stimulation devices, which use a low-level pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) or a low-intensity ultrasound wave (LIPUS) to help heal fractures, and spinal fusions. Many of their devices are wearable and battery powered to allow the user to move during treatment. One such device is the AccelStim Bone Growth Stimulator, which uses ultrasound to encourage bone growth and help heal fractures (FDA, 2022). It is portable, handheld and battery powered, and it has a strap that can hold it in place over the fracture. It must be prescribed by a doctor but is intended for at home use by the patient. It is specifically intended to help heal fractures of the radius and tibia bones in adults and should not be used for skull or spinal fractures. Three other similar devices offered by Orthofix are the CervicalStim, SpinalStim, and PhysioStim, which use PEMF technology to help heal fractures and spinal fusions. They seem to utilize the same core device, but each has a different strap that allows it to fit around different body parts. These three devices are compatible with an app offered by Orthofix, STIM onTrack, which offers more information about the treatment, allows communication with the doctor, and helps patients stay on track with treatments ( Bone Growth Therapy, n.d.). Another bone stimulation device made by a different company, ZimVie, is the OrthoPak, which delivers electromagnetic treatment via electrodes 24 hours per day for 270 days (ZimVie, n.d.). It is intended to treat fractures and is small, lightweight and battery powered so it can be carried with the patient all day. It is also designed to be comfortably worn with fracture boots, splints and braces.
            Although this device would be unique in its ability to offer both bone stimulation and muscle stimulation treatment, there is a wide variety of prescription and in-office devices that perform one treatment very well. It would be difficult for this device to replace these more sophisticated options but there is room to diversify the at-home market with a device that performs both treatments. Additionally, the prescription devices also offer insights in terms of what products work best and the styles that patients prefer using.
